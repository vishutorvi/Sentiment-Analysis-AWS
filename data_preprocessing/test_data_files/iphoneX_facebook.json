But when you decided a while back to make the entire public your beta testers and you all started releasing buggy phones and updates - sorry, you don't deserve that much for your phones.\n\nTo Tim Cook - adopt a little bit of Mr. Jobs \"crazy\".

It's destroying everything in my opinion. It destroys the beauty of full screen photo and video. It destroys the landscape usage of web as well.\nLet's talk about brightness. iPhone is always notorious for having very dim display even in the full brightness level under the direct sunlight. This new iPhone X has not solved this problem too. Brightness is 625nits maximum which is not great enough to see under the direct sunlight. \nCompare with Note 8 which has ~1200 nits maximum. You don't need to worry about direct sunlight to see the contents in your phone. It's very important.\n\n2- security and convenience \n\nFace ID is cool and fancy. But it doesn't give convenience like Touch ID . It also has big doubt about security. \nNo Touch ID is a deal breaker for me.\n\n3- No headphone jack\n\nIt's always my top annoying thing on iPhone.\n\n4- No audio accessory in the box\n\nI've to buy annoying AirPods which is expensive and very impractical to use. Design is awful as hell.\n\n5- Pay to unlock built in fast charging. Wireless charging is not fast.\n\niPhone 8 and X have built in fast charging which is half charging in 30 minutes which is cool. But I've to pay extra 85$ to unlock this built in feature. I've to buy fast charger and USB C cable. Why do I've to pay extra money for a feature which is built in my phone?\nWhy? Non sense at all!\nWireless charging is finally on iPhone. Cool! But it's very slow to charge. Why not to support \"fast wireless charging \" like Samsung? Your phone is not a budget phone , Apple !\n\n6- Stainless steel frame\n\nIt looks cool but gets easily scratched. If you use Apple Watch , you'll know the pain of stainless steel.\nAluminum is better in durability \n\n7- Siri button is the power button.\n\nIt's very annoying to me. I can accidentally activate Siri in my pocket all the time.\n\n8- camera bump and vertical setup \n\nWhy Apple? You've one of best engineer teams in the world. Why there is ugly camera bump every year? Why is it designed vertically for no purpose?\n\n9- base model is 64GB\n\nIt's not enough honestly. Apple supports 4K video 60fps which is very cool and eating the storage very quickly as well. After installing 100 apps and games , how much can I shoot 4K video 60fps ?\nNon sense!\nFor 256GB, I've to pay extra 200$\n\n10- One tap to wake iPhone X. Why not double tap to wake like android? Do you wanna be different? One tap to wake is accidentally waking the screen all the time when I grip my phone. Very annoying !\n\n12- IP rating is still IP 67. Apple , this is 2017! You call iPhone X as the next generation of iPhone. Why don't you support IP 68?\n\n13- Your beloved \"reachability\" feature is gone!\n\nI can guarantee that most of iPhone Plus users use this feature everyday. Although it's not the true one handed mode , it can solve the problem to some extent.\nNow Apple kills this handy feature on iPhone X and doesn't offer any alternative feature for reachability.\n\n14- Price is not pretty!\n999$ for 64GB before tax. Kidding me? This is ridiculous.\n1200$ for 256GB. No way!\n\nDear Apple , this iPhone X is premium phone for you. If you sell it like premium and with 999$ , you've to give all features.\nThe most unacceptable thing is we've to pay extra 85$ to unlock built in fast charging.", "id": "10155645607014598_10155645692414598"}, {"comment": "No", "id": "10155645607014598_10155646044754598"}, {"comment": "Better go for Note 8", "id": "10155645607014598_10155647387779598"}, {"comment": "You know, I like Android's ecosystem for particular reasons: it's customizable, I find the camera quality to be better on devices like the Nexus 6p, Google Pixel and Galaxy S8 over the iPhone 7 Plus and I like how I can manage my files better on Android, almost as freely as I would on a PC; iOS is much too closed off, you're pretty much fucked if you don't own a companion machine like a Mac or PC.\n\nHowever, despite Android's perks, I don't find Android to be very reliable, especially pertaining to long-term use. Every Android device I've ever owned between devices such as the Galaxy S7, HTC One M8, Nexus 6p and Nexus 5 has ALWAYS ran into battery calibration issues; the device would fall out of sync with its battery, shutting off way before the battery hitting 1% or 0% early into device ownership; the Galaxy S4 and Nexus 6p would shut off with nearly 10% remaining. I would run into device freezes, frequent app crashes and the dreaded dropping of device update support (Samsung is the fucking worst for it, they barely update devices once 'next years model' comes out).

These software advancements, coupled with the OIS system on board, help the S8 deliver an overall better-looking low-light shots than its otherwise worthy opponents.

S6 has wider aperture and bigger MP which help low light pictures to become brighter and much more detailed. Selfie is also the same. Wider aperture gives more details. In the daylight, every high end phones can perform very similarly so low light details and selfie are more important than daytime ordinary shots. \nReviewers don't like to say iPhone camera is not good as Galaxy. The reason is they're fans of iPhone. If Galaxy camera has lower MP than iPhone, reviewers would like to say iPhone camera is better cos it has bigger MP. \nReviewers want to play the review game as they want and try to cover the weaknesses of iPhone by saying there's literally subtle difference which won't be known grossly by layman users. But the difference is difference. Galaxy camera is able to perform better in every single aspect than iPhone.\nI'd like to advise you,PhoneArena,how to properly compare the smart phone cameras. There are 4 categories to consider which is better. Lowlight details,color reproduction,selfie and overall daylight details! Video stabilization and audio capturing tech are not an exception to consider which is definitely better! You'd use all these categories to compare fairly.\nMost of the regular users could use snap shots and short videos for Instagram,Facebook ,etc. However,reviews must have proper categories to be considered deeply which is truly better.", "id": "10153677570199598_10153677610439598"}, {"comment": "Lol.
