Thankfully I don't have to worry about it but if I had to my concern wouldn't be that hackers could hack it that's a fact for everything technology my concern would be that Apple could use it however they wanted without you knowing anything about it legally. Of course they say nobody has access to it but do you trust them if you think of the billions of dollars they could make by using and/or selling that data? And with the right wording in the contract you've never read it'd be completely legal too.,2017-11-17T07:42:08+0000,/,10155794400784598_10155804947494598,95359254597_10155794400784598,PhoneArena,facebook

Stay away from free WiFi public hotspots it doesn't matter whether you have iPhone Android or PC if you are on a public WiFi that doesn't require a login key I can get into your device 100% for sure with   little effort.

Funny commercial really.  But honestly it's starting to happen.  I had used iPhones as my primary phone since the iPhone 4.  But things have changed at Apple and once the BUG-FILLED ios 11 updates started to hit and their problems (one after another) I dumped the iPhone and switched to a Moto that costs literally about one-third what an iPhone costs and I'm happy as I can be with it.  My advice to phone makers (Apple and even Samsung to be honest)... if you are going to crank out $700-$1000 phones then those phones had better damn well be PERFECT out of the box.  But when you decided a while back to make the entire public your beta testers and you all started releasing buggy phones and updates - sorry you don't deserve that much for your phones.  To Tim Cook - adopt a little bit of Mr. Jobs "crazy".  Whoever is coding these updates?  They need to be working elsewhere.  He would have made it so long before now.  If you want top dollar for the phones and updates then give people a flawless product for that price.,2017-11-06T15:36:46+0000,/,10155775226124598_10155775986444598,95359254597_10155775226124598,PhoneArena,facebook

It's to be expected. The phone is very expensive and the notch is one of the dumbest designs Apple has ever come up with. I hope Apple learns from this device but somehow I feel like we know they won't. Apple loves to force people to change how they use their phone and what features they should and should not have. Samsung learned this lesson hard with the gs6 and it showed very clearly with the gs7. Hope you grow apple.

First off the phone is expensive for something with old hardware that android phones had for years already now the iphone only got 3gb ram i see that has a no becasue after few updates its a slow phone all the new android phones now got 8gb ram at least and the phones are cheaper then this iphone to me its a waste of money to get this phone lol,2017-11-08T17:48:03+0000,/,10155775221959598_10155781314979598,95359254597_10155775221959598,PhoneArena,facebook

Battery life has taken a huge hit. Camera defaults to live shots on its own. If you turn wi-fi off in the control center turn airplane mode on and then turn it off wi-fi turns on again. You must go into settings and turn off wi-off. Automatic brightness adjustment is now buried under General Accessibility.   Overall operating system is much slow.

The phone is good but is it worth the price? Here in India the starting price is nearly 1300$.  Frankly specs wise Samsung S8 is superior.   iOS experience is not unique any more and Android phones today are more not less capable than iPhones.

That was an unfortunate firing for something like that.  He should've gotten a suspension.  Suspension would be been appropriate for this.

Her dad should of taken full responsibility. You sign NDAs and keep these things confidential because its the companies policy. If anything its lapse in judgement on his part to tell her to put away the camera. As an employee hes has to also be an enforcer as well. There are rumors where he might of did this to get out of Apple and the non compete clause since it isnt carried out if terminated but for a guy like this it can make or break him depending on if they see this as an opportunity to get him or see him as a liability/threat for not being mindful of his job responsibility,2017-10-29T01:53:02+0000,/,10155752561024598_10155752583589598,95359254597_10155752561024598,PhoneArena,facebook

I like how she disabled the comments section on her YouTube video pertaining to the situation . Well the firing shows what kind of environment this women was raised in. Obviously the need to feed her self absorption and put her narcissism on display wasnt concerning enough to shut down by her parents. She said she doesnt blame Apple for the situation and rightfully so because this situation is 95% her fault 5% the dads fault for not realizing how attention hungry his stupid daughter is to make a video about something she would/should clearly know not to make record of until the phones release day.

Uhhhhh that's because no one wants to spend ~$900-1200 based on configuration for the same ol' yr in and yr out. That's rent money here for something that someone will upgrade in 2 yrs max. There's no innovation @ Apple. They take features that Android and Microsoft has had for years and market it as new and groundbreaking and all those iTards be going crazy for them. Plus you have competition from other OEMs which offer more or the same for much less.

Fools the iPhone isn't zoomed in. The Galaxy selfie cam is wide angle which means more can fit in one frame. Both phones were held at the same distance I've tested this myself. Also pictures taken with the Galaxy selfie cam have an airbrushed look to them no matter what settings you use and it's even more apparent when you take the picture up close. I'm the biggest Android fanboy but when it comes to selfies Apple has us beat and it's been that way for a few years at least.

yes both S8 and Note8 look better than the iPhone 8 and even iPhone X. I really dislike that front camera design the X has. I think Samsung and LG has done it better with a minimal bezel design.,2017-10-11T17:09:11+0000,/,10155705713204598_10155705826314598,95359254597_10155705713204598,PhoneArena,facebook

I have to say Apple have done amazing and their designs have impressed especially when they moved from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6/7. However Samsung definitely takes the crown the S8 is sleek it's nice feels premium and feels awesome especially when you consider your holding a 5.8/6.2 inch display but the phones doesn't make it look that. Samsung & Apple are amazing though so hopefully apples next phone will surprise us.,2017-10-11T17:38:52+0000,/,10155705713204598_10155705891884598,95359254597_10155705713204598,PhoneArena,facebook

Top reasons why you shouldn't buy iPhone X !  1- display notch and brightness   It's OLED display and almost edge to edge which is cool but the destruction of the beauty is notch at the top. It's destroying everything in my opinion. It destroys the beauty of full screen photo and video. It destroys the landscape usage of web as well. Let's talk about brightness. iPhone is always notorious for having very dim display even in the full brightness level under the direct sunlight. This new iPhone X has not solved this problem too. Brightness is 625nits maximum which is not great enough to see under the direct sunlight.  Compare with Note 8 which has ~1200 nits maximum. You don't need to worry about direct sunlight to see the contents in your phone. It's very important.  2- security and convenience   Face ID is cool and fancy. But it doesn't give convenience like Touch ID . It also has big doubt about security.  No Touch ID is a deal breaker for me.  3- No headphone jack  It's always my top annoying thing on iPhone.  4- No audio accessory in the box  I've to buy annoying AirPods which is expensive and very impractical to use. Design is awful as hell.  5- Pay to unlock built in fast charging. Wireless charging is not fast.  iPhone 8 and X have built in fast charging which is half charging in 30 minutes which is cool. But I've to pay extra 85$ to unlock this built in feature. I've to buy fast charger and USB C cable. Why do I've to pay extra money for a feature which is built in my phone? Why? Non sense at all! Wireless charging is finally on iPhone. Cool! But it's very slow to charge. Why not to support "fast wireless charging " like Samsung? Your phone is not a budget phone  Apple !  6- Stainless steel frame  It looks cool but gets easily scratched. If you use Apple Watch  you'll know the pain of stainless steel. Aluminum is better in durability   7- Siri button is the power button.  It's very annoying to me. I can accidentally activate Siri in my pocket all the time.  8- camera bump and vertical setup   Why Apple? You've one of best engineer teams in the world. Why there is ugly camera bump every year? Why is it designed vertically for no purpose?  9- base model is 64GB  It's not enough honestly. Apple supports 4K video 60fps which is very cool and eating the storage very quickly as well. After installing 100 apps and games  how much can I shoot 4K video 60fps ? Non sense! For 256GB I've to pay extra 200$  10- One tap to wake iPhone X. Why not double tap to wake like android? Do you wanna be different? One tap to wake is accidentally waking the screen all the time when I grip my phone. Very annoying !  12- IP rating is still IP 67. Apple  this is 2017! You call iPhone X as the next generation of iPhone. Why don't you support IP 68?  13- Your beloved "reachability" feature is gone!  I can guarantee that most of iPhone Plus users use this feature everyday. Although it's not the true one handed mode  it can solve the problem to some extent. Now Apple kills this handy feature on iPhone X and doesn't offer any alternative feature for reachability.  14- Price is not pretty! 999$ for 64GB before tax. Kidding me? This is ridiculous. 1200$ for 256GB. No way!  Dear Apple  this iPhone X is premium phone for you. If you sell it like premium and with 999$  you've to give all features. The most unacceptable thing is we've to pay extra 85$ to unlock built in fast charging.,2017-09-19T11:25:33+0000,/,10155645607014598_10155645692414598,95359254597_10155645607014598,PhoneArena,facebook

IPhone or let's say Apple didn't bring anything new they just copied technology Samsung and other had it years before . Even iPhone C display is Samsung MADE.  IPhone x is Samsung s8 with iOS but worst no memory card extension no dual SIM and yet s8 coast cheaper.   Apple is playing catching up game while Samsung is innovating technology.

You know I like Android's ecosystem for particular reasons: it's customizable I find the camera quality to be better on devices like the Nexus 6p Google Pixel and Galaxy S8 over the iPhone 7 Plus and I like how I can manage my files better on Android almost as freely as I would on a PC; iOS is much too closed off you're pretty much fucked if you don't own a companion machine like a Mac or PC.  However despite Android's perks I don't find Android to be very reliable especially pertaining to long-term use. Every Android device I've ever owned between devices such as the Galaxy S7 HTC One M8 Nexus 6p and Nexus 5 has ALWAYS ran into battery calibration issues; the device would fall out of sync with its battery shutting off way before the battery hitting 1% or 0% early into device ownership; the Galaxy S4 and Nexus 6p would shut off with nearly 10% remaining. I would run into device freezes frequent app crashes and the dreaded dropping of device update support (Samsung is the fucking worst for it they barely update devices once 'next years model' comes out). I would have loved staying with Android and enjoying the freedoms that comes with the operating system but it is so bad for regular user issues.,2017-09-19T02:38:40+0000,/,10155644072294598_10155644339789598,95359254597_10155644072294598,PhoneArena,facebook

What's new? Why is anyone even surprised? iPhones have always been faster than adroid devices. More powerful CPU coupled with Apple's integration with both hardware and software. Practically no fragmentation. But that doesn't mean the S8 or Note 8 are slow devices. I don't think people buy phones these days for speed alone.

Of course it was a Face ID error stop making bullshit excuses for Apple. The technology failed at the presentation because he had something on his face that's why he wiped his face. It failed twice until he wiped his face and it worked the third time so it obviously wasn't anything to do with whoever prepared the phone for the presentation. It obviously still has loads of bugs and it was a worldwide embarrassment for Apple. Really see this like the very first generation Touch ID when it would be hit and miss before they developed the technology further in later generation phones,2017-09-15T14:47:52+0000,/,10155630887499598_10155630927624598,95359254597_10155630887499598,PhoneArena,facebook

You dumb ass. This phone was being used at the presentation by multiple people and since those people were not the "owner" of the phone passcode option for activated. Same thing that happens when someone's finger prints that are not registered in previous iPhones tries to unlock it multiple times the passcode option gets activated after which even if the owner tries to unlock the iPhone with Touch ID or face id. This is what iPhone is supposed to do.

One thing you MUST give Apple credit for is the engineering and design that goes into the production of most their devices. You can take an Apple iphone apart rebuild it a hundred times and each time and every time the phone will go back together as it should and fully function. The same can not be said for any other mainstream manufacture of smartphone with their shite flex cables sticky tape glue and general piss poor design (yes HTC and Sony pointing my finger at you bastards).  Even though Apple are a bunch of wankers for such things as shitty soldering of chipsets (Baseband chips wifi/bluettooth Power IC failing for no reason whatsoever) and their laughable 'Error' codes they are still miles ahead of the competition. The second hand phone market for Apple products is booming and its a testiment to their design.  (But they can boil their heads over the design of ipod touch....soldering a battery into place... the pricks),2017-07-19T12:01:21+0000,/,10155466641024598_10155466788284598,95359254597_10155466641024598,PhoneArena,facebook

Taimur Nadeem Khan. Tbh I'm a bit disappointed with OP5. But there's no reason to bash them. They're doing a splendid job in creating robust smartphones there's no smartphone today touching the $500 mark with the specs OP5 has to offer. And if you're really concerned with the camera go buy a fucking DSLR.  I'd say +1 to OnePlus 5.,2017-06-22T15:39:42+0000,/,10155371199684598_10155371383579598,95359254597_10155371199684598,PhoneArena,facebook

Conclusion  Although all four cameras have their weaknesses and strong sides and some did better than others in certain situations one of them managed to deliver consistently better results across the board. And this is the Samsung Galaxy S8.  Although not a huge leap forward from last year's S7 technically speaking the Galaxy S8 benefits from an improved camera software and image processing algorithms. These software advancements coupled with the OIS system on board help the S8 deliver an overall better-looking low-light shots than its otherwise worthy opponents. The other three are not far behind but as isbetween these four contenders and as far as low-light camera performance goesthe Galaxy S8 has a clear edge.,2017-05-24T08:51:17+0000,/,10155276803334598_10155278216544598,95359254597_10155276803334598,PhoneArena,facebook

People are finally catching on too Apple's marketing and if you want proof the Tech media still wants to kiss Apple's booty by not reporting Apple's current status I'm showing four consecutive quarters of negative growth on their biggest money maker the iPhone but yet the tech media wants to report on the past but currently not Apple's present situation which isn't all that great especially from a financial standpoint,2017-01-09T09:49:27+0000,/,10154852739429598_10154852811039598,95359254597_10154852739429598,PhoneArena,facebook

That's funny because Note users are traditionally hardcore Android users. There are so many things you get with Android that they don't even remember  not on surface that they will immediately find out iOS does not.

Samsung didn't push me away because of the note 7 issue. They did with their awful software changes lately and forced updates. Getting rid of the s7edge this week.

(except for the original iPhone back in 2007 where they defined the smartphone interface of touchscreen) Apple simply repackage old/current technology and then sell it in premium packaging. They're not an innovator... They're just a marketing company..,2016-08-11T02:16:11+0000,/,10154375091274598_10154375166994598,95359254597_10154375091274598,PhoneArena,facebook
This has not been a good day for Apple at all because it has also been reported that Samsung is #1 and this is more proof of it.

The iPhone 7 surely won't garnish the attention that the the 2017 iPhone will. But with the MacBook line refresh and Apple Watch 2 coming directly followed by the already ultra-hyped 'iPhone 8' I think Apple will rebound just fine from any short-term disappointment.,2016-08-11T03:21:01+0000,/,10154375091274598_10154375270689598,95359254597_10154375091274598,PhoneArena,facebook

Maybe if they would make some real changes then that would help them. I hate apple iOS. But love the design of the phone.

I think Apple has got it with design and they win that but they have some terrible OS look at Android its creative its different and it stands out a lot meaning it is unique and thats why it is still on top. Maybe if Apple looked at making their system a lot more fun and nicer to use more people would then use it. Apple have done well but they need to change up their game if they want to stay in the game here as Android has come back and even stronger too. But good game Android looks like Marshallow has done what it needs to and draw people in.,2016-04-07T08:35:52+0000,/,10154054732674598_10154055713719598,95359254597_10154054732674598,PhoneArena,facebook

It looks nice and the camera looks interesting... BUT eliminating the headphone jack to gain just an INSIGNIFICANT ONE MILLIMETER less in thickness that's plain stupid and an insult to people's intelligence.  Removing the headphone jack for extreme thinness sake was cute as an experiment on the Oppo R5. But a flagship like the iPhone should not skip it.  It's my opinion at least. :/,2016-03-16T09:57:44+0000,/,10153974825769598_10153974909154598,95359254597_10153974825769598,PhoneArena,facebook
Why does the iPhone keep getting uglier and uglier with every iteratiin?

What a shame apple has become. But they still will pull this trick cause a lot of people specially those who doesnt know very well about technology fell on to the trap that apple products make the consumer feel more wealthy or fancy.

Looks like iHaters is rising again here probably because not only of this news you guys complaints about Apple forgetting headphone jack?!. They are trying to do a bit simplicity here!.  If you guys don't like it stay away with your iPhones or Androids.  Honestly I don't like that happen too but I can understand what Apple is doing.  By the way don't look at me like iDiots here!. I like both Androids and iDevices. But I think iOS is good on iPad while android is good on smartphones.  You can keep complain about it but hating it is not the good way to suggest something!. :(,2016-03-16T10:29:08+0000,/,10153974825769598_10153974979599598,95359254597_10153974825769598,PhoneArena,facebook

Its kind of respond to its decision to remove an universal port "prise audio jack" to make the iphone thinner  so they make this caricature to give hef an excuse. I think its a manipulation of customrrs opinion.  1 mm its not a big deal to took away tbus option. And as a bro said and its vefy well said: listening to your customers once in awhile won't hurt hou. What about a company that is never listen to her customers.  Just for exemple and im not comaparing here  samsung will bring back the micro sd slot again  and thats under pressure of its own customers. I think apple has become a "relegion" every thing says this.  I read an article about it.

There was a large blind test on Android Central and majority pics iPhone photos despite the S6 having a better camera. I think iPhone handles exposures in highlights and shadows better and preserved skies a lot better.,2015-11-03T14:21:57+0000,/,10153677570199598_10153677624394598,95359254597_10153677570199598,PhoneArena,facebook

No it's not. S6 camera is very much better than iPhone 6.,2015-11-03T14:16:04+0000,/,10153677570199598_10153677619214598,95359254597_10153677570199598,PhoneArena,facebook
Details especially in the low light is the key factor to decide which is better. S6 has wider aperture and bigger MP which help low light pictures to become brighter and much more detailed. Selfie is also the same. Wider aperture gives more details. In the daylight every high end phones can perform very similarly so low light details and selfie are more important than daytime ordinary shots.  Reviewers don't like to say iPhone camera is not good as Galaxy. The reason is they're fans of iPhone. If Galaxy camera has lower MP than iPhone reviewers would like to say iPhone camera is better cos it has bigger MP.  Reviewers want to play the review game as they want and try to cover the weaknesses of iPhone by saying there's literally subtle difference which won't be known grossly by layman users. But the difference is difference. Galaxy camera is able to perform better in every single aspect than iPhone. I'd like to advise youPhoneArenahow to properly compare the smart phone cameras. There are 4 categories to consider which is better. Lowlight detailscolor reproductionselfie and overall daylight details! Video stabilization and audio capturing tech are not an exception to consider which is definitely better! You'd use all these categories to compare fairly. Most of the regular users could use snap shots and short videos for InstagramFacebook etc. Howeverreviews must have proper categories to be considered deeply which is truly better.,2015-11-03T14:07:24+0000,/,10153677570199598_10153677610439598,95359254597_10153677570199598,PhoneArena,facebook

They should remove the home button. To return to home screen one press to the home button. To access the multitasking two press to the home button. I will never use a phone with that setup. On BlackBerry is so easy to turn on the screen you just need to swype the finger from the bottom of the screen to almost the middle of the screen. To get out of an app and return to the home screen is the same gesture. To access the multitasking once you are on the home screen just a swype to the right. I love the gestures setups on BlackBerry 10.,2015-05-26T22:42:41+0000,/,10153311540854598_10153312794469598,95359254597_10153311540854598,PhoneArena,facebook

You'll also be using apps and games on the phone and some of those games are quite heavy. Think about that before you actually say Android sucks. Have fun guys.

Stop defending Apple for not giving its customers hardware that will withstand the next generations of iOS. They limit the hardware just to be able to force you to upgrade later on.

This is a great deal for the unsuspecting customer or for someone who has run out of patience due to waiting for the release of the 5S. This will give Apple a chance to sell off as many leftover iPhone 5 models they have to make way for the 5S model when released. It's a shame though...seeing those poor defenseless newly signed owners of the iPhone 5 watching tv and seeing a commercial for the iPhone 5S. I almost can't wait to see the looks on their faces.,2013-08-16T03:57:35+0000,/,10151796983974598_27152951,95359254597_10151796983974598,PhoneArena,facebook

There are a lot of phones that will crush the iPhone 5. I own a iPhone 5 and this thing bores me to death already. I traded my Galaxy 3 for it and that was a bad mistake.

Both are nice devices.  I prefer Android though due to the fact that you can get Emulators on the market without rooting or any hassle...on the iPhone you have to jailbreak which always causes crashes and system instability in my experience.

There's a difference between the most popular device and the best device that will give the best overall user experience...  as a tech; you always want to ensure your customers questions are answered effectively and efficiently...  now if someone asked me of the latest device's of course I would respond with not just android models but iPhone and wp as well...  if someone asked me wats the latest devices that offer the latest technologies...  I would have to say the former as well...  difference is.. when someone presents a general question..  " I'm looking for a new device... " of course you will naturally offer them the most updated device..  I always tell my customers..  disregard popular belief...  everything is not for everybody...  I'm in the Technology field and regardless what most people believe... iPhone is popular just like a cigarette is popular to a teenager...  peer pressure...  if you are not smoking ur not cool etc..  same with iPhone...  everyone has a iPhone..  its cool its popular... its the most simplistic piece of technology and the most restrictive piece of technology...  but is it the most innovative not in the least..  does it offer the greatest user experience not at all...  doest it offer the most simple user experience...  yes sir it does..  in fact... its such a simple user experience that geico should utilize the opportunity of saying..  its so easy a caveman can do it... just my opinion...,2012-05-04T17:34:28+0000,/,95359254597:10150815931364598:10101331650483551_10100262483777422,95359254597_10150815931364598,PhoneArena,facebook
